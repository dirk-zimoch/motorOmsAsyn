Please note:

- The MAXnet IP-stack is very basic. You cannot ping the card and it doesn't know 
  anything about routing, which means you can only use it from hosts in the same
  subnet.
- MAXnet cards with firmware versions older than 1.33.4 shouldn't be used
  with the ethernet port. They abort communication, if they detect a tcp packet 
  with checksum 0xffff.
- Input EOS defaults to "\n\r", output EOS defaults to "\n".
  Since this may not fit every combination of firmware version and serial/IP selection,
  it can be set by calling asynOctetSet[In|Out]putEos prior to calling omsMAXnetConfig()

add this to st.cmd if using the ethernet port:
  drvAsynIPPortConfigure("MAXNET","maxnet-ip-address:23",0,0,0)

add this to st.cmd if using the serial port:
  drvAsynSerialPortConfigure("MAXNET","/your/serial/device",0,0,0)
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"baud","115200")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"bits","8")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"parity","none")
  asynSetOption("MAXNET",0,"crtscts","Y")

set the input/output EOS based on the MAXnet firmware version:
  
  ### Uncomment one of the following two lines:
  #asynOctetSetInputEos("MAXNET",0,"\n\r")
  #asynOctetSetInputEos("MAXNET",0,"\n")
  asynOctetSetOutputEos("MAXNET",0,"\n")
